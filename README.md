# Motocraft Sever
A WIP custom server for Motocraft, released by Cheetah Mobile or some other company in 2017.

## Important
In the current state, the server is not ready for playing yet, as there are many features missing.
Stuff like the initialdata is missing which causes progress not to save and other bugs.
If you played this version or have the data for it please contact me.

## Features
Working Adventure map up to node 5 (stuff get buggy after node 4)
You can switch cars by changine the CurCar key in logincontroller.cs to a number between 0 and 2 (in the server)

## Getting Started
For now, you will have to build (compile) the server yourself.

Check the [apk patching](docs/apk-patching.md) tutorial for more info
